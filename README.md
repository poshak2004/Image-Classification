Image Classifier with TensorFlow
Overview
This project is a deep learning image classification model implemented in Python using TensorFlow. The model is designed to classify images into predefined categories based on the input images provided. This repository includes code for building, training, and evaluating the model, as well as utilities for preprocessing images.

Features
Image Classification: Classify images into categories with high accuracy.
Customizable: Easily modify the number of classes and the dataset.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing steps to prepare images for training.
Model Evaluation: Tools for evaluating model performance and visualizing results.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
You can install the required Python packages using pip:


pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd image-classifier
Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation
Place your dataset in the data/ directory. The dataset should be organized into subdirectories, where each subdirectory represents a class.

Update the dataset path in config.py if necessary.

Training the Model
To train the model, run:


python train.py

This script will:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Define and compile the TensorFlow model.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Save the trained model to models/ directory.


Evaluating the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model using:
python evaluate.py
T
his script will:
Load the trained model.
Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
Print out performance metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Making Predictions
To make predictions on new images, use:
python predict.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg
This script will:

Load the trained model.
Preprocess the input image.
Output the predicted class for the input image.
Configuration
Modify config.py to adjust parameters such as:

Path to the dataset
Number of epochs
Batch size
Model architecture settings
Directory Structure
bash
