#Image Classifier with TensorFlow

##Overview
This project is a deep learning image classification model implemented in Python using TensorFlow. The model is designed to classify images into predefined categories based on the input images provided. This repository includes code for building, training, and evaluating the model, as well as utilities for preprocessing images.

Features
Image Classification: Classify images into categories with high accuracy.
Customizable: Easily modify the number of classes and the dataset.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing steps to prepare images for training.
Model Evaluation: Tools for evaluating model performance and visualizing results.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
